            <h5 class="text-muted">Why we are doing this</h5>
            <p class="text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We establish this website which contains videos of representative trajectories 
              for a variety of organic reactions. We focus on reactions taught in undergraduate organic chemistry courses. 
              The goal is to provide instructors with videos they can show students of molecules vibrating in meaningful ways while reacting. 
              In our experience, students generally come away from organic courses thinking that molecular structures transform smoothly 
              from reactant(s) to transition state to product(s) (as in IRC pathways) — a misconception against which we intend to fight.
                </p>
            <p class="text-left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we use the DFT methods described above to locate TSSs for representative SN2, E2, 1,2-alkyl shift, alkene 
              halogenation, hydride addition to an aldehyde, primary ozonide formation, Diels-Alder, and Cope rearrangement 
              reactions, along with TSSs for amine inversion, rotation about the central C–C bond of butane and the first step of a chair 
              flip. We then subject these to direct dynamics trajectory simulations as described above. For each reaction, we post
               videos of representative trajectories for the most common means of connecting reactants and products along with animations of
                IRC pathways for comparison. We also include videos of examples of rare trajectories to emphasize that these also occur. 
                We envision this databank expanding continuously over time.</p>
